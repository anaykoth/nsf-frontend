                    Picture this: a hackathon hall alive with excitement, yet we couldn't shake off a touch of morning lethargy on a regular Saturday. Brought to you by Arnav Mubrakar, Akash Puzhakkal, Anay Kothana, and Pratham Pilli, we are <b>SynthSense</b>, and our journey kicked off fueled by ambition, creativity, and a bit of naivety. Inspired by NJ Transit's challenge at the annual HackRU, a pivotal decision loomed to transition from web to mobile app development, showcasing adaptability and quick decision-making.
                    Our award-winning app, designed for bus services, seamlessly integrated user inputs, routes, and an AI-driven one-day trip planner. Building on this success, we ventured into the health-tech realm at HackHealth, developing MinDerva â€” a project that caught the attention of industry mentor Andrew Gordon. Under Andrew's guidance, our newly formed startup, SynthSense, secured a spot in the National Science Foundation's I-Corps program, receiving a $3,000 grant. Now poised to attend the Consumer Electronic Showcase in Las Vegas, SynthSense's journey is a testament to resilience, collaboration, and the boundless potential of youthful innovation in the startup and app development landscape.
